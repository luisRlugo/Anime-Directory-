# Project Name: Anime Search List

Users are able to see a list of Anime they searched and when clicked on one it'll pop up a description about as well as a link for further details.

# Motivation

I love anime and wanted to create a webiste where anyone can look up any anime and get details about it, in hopes that it'll make them want to watch it.

# Goals

I want the webiste to automatic show up a list of popular anime.
I want to add a Filter so that the user can chose from certain genres.
I want to add a Manga page and have that generate any manga the user looks up.
I also want to add a characters pop up.
